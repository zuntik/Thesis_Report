I would like to thank my parents and sister for their encouragement, caring and support over all these years, for always being there for me through thick and thin and without whom this project would not be possible.

I would also like to acknowledge my dissertation supervisor, Prof. Pascoal for his insight, support and sharing of knowledge that has made this thesis possible.

%This has been a strange year with such a fast spreading pandemic going on, therefor, I would like to thank Pitchaporn Paitoing, in particualar, for her company during this long quarantine.
