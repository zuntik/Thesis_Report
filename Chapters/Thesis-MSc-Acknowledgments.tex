I would like to thank my parents for their friendship, encouragement and caring over all these years, for always being there for me through thick and thin and without whom this project would not be possible. I would also like to thank my grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins for their understanding and support throughout all these years.

I would also like to acknowledge my dissertation supervisors Prof. Some Name and Prof. Some Other Name for their insight, support and sharing of knowledge that has made this Thesis possible.

Last but not least, to all my friends and colleagues that helped me grow as a person and were always there for me during the good and bad times in my life. Thank you.

To each and every one of you -- Thank you.
