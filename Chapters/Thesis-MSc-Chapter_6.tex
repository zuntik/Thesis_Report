\par With this initial study, problems associated with cooperative motion planning was studied with the objective of developing and testing selected algorithms on a number of prototype vehicles that are property of ISR-TÃ©cnico. A suite of programs has been developed that perform calculations on Bezier Curves which will prove useful for the later stages of the project. Also, an introduction with Matlab's optimisation tools has allowed an important understanding of their limitations and benefits. Basic concepts like trajectories, paths and linear and non-linear constraints for optimisation problems have been researched.
\par  This initial study has provided me with a clear understanding of how to carry out a research project. This includes how to define a scientific problem, investigating its importance and relevance within the wider scientific area, how to investigate the state of the art and how to develop the research over a limited time-scale.
