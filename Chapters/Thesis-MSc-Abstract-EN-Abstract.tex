\par This thesis presents methods for cooperative motion control for control of fleets of underwater autonomous robots. Good, robust, and fast-to-calculate methods for multiple underwater vehicle motion control is important to take into account inter-vehicle constraints, environmental constraints, energy consumption and mission duration. A suite of programs have been developed using Matlab that generate approximations of optimal trajectories for vehicles in a 2D space. %These programs will be extended for calculating trajectories for multiple cooperative robots. %The programs will eventually be implemented in autonomous robots of the medusa class from ISR-TÃ©cnico.
