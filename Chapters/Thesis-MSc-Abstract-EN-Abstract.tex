This report presents an initial investigation of some of the methods for cooperative motion control as preparation for the study of the control of fleets of underwater autonomous robots. This will be carried out throughout the second semester of 2019/2020 and will be the subject of a master's thesis in Decision Systems and Control. Good, robust, and fast-to-calculate methods for multiple underwater vehicle motion control is important to take into account inter-vehicle constraints, environmental constraints, energy consumption and mission duration.  A suite of programs have been developed using Matlab that generate approximations of optimal trajectories for single vehicles in a 2D space. These programs will be extended for calculating trajectories for multiple cooperative robots. The programs will eventually be implemented in autonomous robots of the medusa class from ISR-TÃ©cnico.
